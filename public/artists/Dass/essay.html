<p class="center_subhead" >Essay on Dean Dass</p>
<p class="center_subhead_2">Nature and Memory </p>
  <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">An often cited passage by Jorge Luis Borges   refers to a Chinese encyclopedia that divides animals as follows: (a) belonging   to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f)   fabulous, (g) stray dogs (h) included in the present classification, (i)   frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush (l) et   cetera. The passage pokes fun at science's absurd attempts to find order in a   fragmented and irrational world. Using similar tools of playful 'scientific'   classification, Dean Dass presents prints and paintings that, although   beautiful, are also ominous. Beneath glowing paint and delicate inked lines   hovers a sense of the untimely or sorrowful. The incongruity in the work alludes   to the ambiguous position of the artist who warns of catastrophe but still risks   crawling, like Borges' shaman in 'The Circular Ruins,' into abandoned ruins to   dream into existence a perfect man. </p>
  <p>
    <span class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Mnemosyne also raises the larger   question of the individual's relationship to history. The work itself figures   the continual disintegration and regeneration of systems of order in the natural   and social world and in art and knowledge. It imagines that perhaps, in the   collapse of Arcadias and the overturn of hierarchies, lies the possibility for   new insights and new images. </span></p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">
  The collage One Arm, Many Parts embodies in   the broken image of a scarred forearm the entire exhibition. Historically, the   unblemished human body represents wholeness and order, and reflects the   perfection of the universe. In Dass's image, the arm is riddled with   imperfection and incomplete. The trope is repeated in one of the collage   elements-fragments of photographs of Dass's egg sculptures. The smooth blonde   wooden eggs have produced within themselves spots of a different wood. Both   images represent the threatening emergence of difference within wholeness. But   then these odd collage bits, including rough oval shaped cuts from digital   prints, shield-shaped flakes of mica, and painted elements, assume another   order, grouping themselves by kind, in a scientific manner, and ranging in neat   rows across the surface of the print. </p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">
  Productive disjunctions and gaps   structure both the hanging of the work in the exhibition and the pieces   themselves. The paintings and prints are gathered into uncertain but vivid   categories: canoeists, cosmos, foxes, landscapes, explosions. The same   heterogeneity erupts within the works themselves. The disjointed subject matter   and complex materials combine to represent the perplexed relationship of   individual to world. The exhibition is, therefore, similar to Renaissance   collections, which were constructed as microcosms with both man-made and natural   works of art. </p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">
  Choosing prophetic moments in history--the beginnings and   endings of eras--Dass allegorizes them for the present. One example is his suite   of prints For Girolamo Fracastoro, the 16th century writer commissioned by the   Spanish crown to celebrate Columbus' expedition. The resulting book was titled   'Syphilis' and in it, the author placed a curse for the conquerors in the mouths   of the native birds who were escaping their guns. In these prints, fragile   birds, illustrations from a science book, utter fiery and explosive curses   against science and us. Of the two species, animals are the wiser. Dass   frequently overturns the hierarchy between human and animal knowledge and mocks   the traditional triumphant tone of historical and scientific narratives whose   purpose has been to subdue the natural world and turn it into something useful. </p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">
  Often, in the prints, foreboding for the future and the predicament of   the modern individual has been figured as images of disease. The motif recurs in   images borrowed from medical books and in the form of elements scattered   randomly, like bacteria, across the surface of the paper. These images are also   ambiguous, reading sometimes as signs of refreshment and renewal such as   landscapes, registers of lakes, growing cells, stars or comets.</p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">
  In the   same way, the fragmentary body also opens to the possibility of a whole body and   a world that makes sense. Borges' shaman, who, beginning with a beating heart,   dreams an entire ideal human, symbolizes such an artistic ethos. But is an   artist able now to reoccupy such a Romantic position? For Dass, the problem is   raised most poignantly in the act of painting. </p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">
  Visually, some of the   prints work in a manner similar to painting. Using different types of paper and   ink, they play with surface and the illusion of depth, opacity and translucency,   revealing and obscuring. Although inkjet printers or presses produce the images,   the formal parameters are similar to those of painting. </p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">
  But Dass is   highly conscious that painting in modernism, and after photography, has a   complicated history. To paint landscapes or anything else now is to take up a   long Romantic tradition that many have argued has been exhausted. However, Dass   wants to make works that will manifest simultaneously two positions: a painting   that seems believable, unmediated, and whole, but which, at the same time,   reveals itself as a beautiful illusion, and points the viewer back to the world   to illuminate its fallen state. </p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">
  The material solution of this problem   lies in the treatment of the painting surface. An image that appears to have   bloomed within the pigment itself, like the images of saints and gods that   appear spontaneously in the natural world, is removed from the realm of culture   or history. Paintings such as these seek the authority of natural fact. At the   same time, their content remains similar to the prints. Fires burn down to   embers in twilight. Buildings are being built. Suns set in lonely winter   landscapes. Villages are bombed and burned. The pieces represent beginnings and   endings--moments from history. </p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">
  Borges' perfect man lived, ignorant of   his own history, only to discover with horror that he was a figment from a   dream. Because they carry world and personal histories, or more exactly, memory,   Dass' paintings are not like Borges' ideal creation. These paintings are more   like Dass' fragile cursing animals. They present themselves as reproaches to   humanity manifested by nature itself. </p>
