      <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Matter matters. My task as a visual artist is to transform tangible matter. We live in a world of matter that informs all of our senses, evokes our most primordial emotions and roots us to the universe. Therefore, I have learned that the key to making miraculous art is less likely to be held in the artist’s mind than in her hands. Refuting the notion that his work manifested a philosophy of transcendence, the modern abstract painter, Marc Rothko insisted that he was giving us a material experience, the sensuousness of the world in all its richness. According to him, his work was “about” as well as “of” this world. This is why I hold a deep respect for the matter I manipulate and the ensuing enmeshment of material and ideas that occurs in my creative process. This enmeshment in representational painting often occurs when the material and the motif become one. When realism is evoked through the plasticity of the paint medium itself and the canvas becomes more than a mere illusionist picture. This is the heavy weight of Morandi’s paint turning into wet clay when he paints his still life objects as if he were painting gravity itself. Or the oily sea of Turner’s pictures when they submerge, churn and float in unison with his palette. Or Van Gogh’s “Potato Eaters” that he expressed to his brother, Theo, is an attempt to make the paint as the dirt that the “eaters” ate on their potatoes.</p>

<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">The artist William DeKooning once said that oil painting was invented to depict flesh. So, I ask, why was acrylic paint invented? I had always snubbed the medium as inferior to the great tradition of oil painting. That was, until I started to paint plastic toys and then my sixteenth century painting material failed miserably to depict a mid-twentieth century substance. For all its modeling and illusionism, somewhere in my pictures of plastic toys it had to flatten out like melted plastic stuck to canvas. Only with acrylic paint, (plastic virtually painting plastic), could I produce that magically place where the material and the motif fused into one.</p> 

<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Beyond the material, the motifs in my paintings struggle. The events of 9/11 profoundly shook my illusions of a safe and secure world. So the armies of cartoon characters and salvage store superheroes that make up my piles of plastic toys have become a personal metaphor for the varying factions of external forces rallying to destroy or save us. In addition, abstractionism and realism struggle to co-exist on the picture plane and the antithetical applications of loose expressionism and focused control scuffle to find resolution. I paint the toys from observation and I fight to find visual clarity as I fall into vertigo over the extreme colors and mass consumer objects. Still, it’s the depiction of plastic that I feel makes my work truly contemporary and where it can best make a contribution to the history of painting. What is this matter that we have surrounded ourselves with in increasing amounts since the 1960’s and how do I make humans aware of its omnipresence in their lives?</p>

<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_subhead">Pensive Play: <br />
  The New Paintings of Megan Marlatt</p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Like Rocky and Bullwinkle, sometimes called the first cartoon for adults, these paintings are not really for kids,&rdquo; laughed artist Megan Marlatt, discussing her work during a recent studio visit. I agree, and not just because Marlatt&rsquo;s new paintings, like the escapades of &ldquo;moose and squirrel,&rdquo; smartly gravitate towards dark humor. Rendered through an adroit painterliness, these new large-scale easel paintings of mounds of garish plastic toys transform objects of childhood play into sites of mature melancholy and uncertainty. This occurs visually and aesthetically through a fusion of still life with landscape, and conceptually, like classic fairy tales, through an inconspicuous translation of the everyday language of juvenile amusement into an array of symbols of adult variance and power politics. The best of her new paintings, like <em>Under the Watchful Eye of the Elephant</em> and <em>Orange Slinky</em>, are generous because of the dialectic of childhood and adulthood they involuntarily embrace&mdash;how each of these two phases of life, through desire, struggle, and hope, contains elements of the other, and how each phase, with both longing and disapproval, gazes at the other. </p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Marlatt&rsquo;s new paintings are anchored in many of the devices of traditional still life painting. The subject matter is literally objects on a table, and these objects function both aesthetically and as signifiers, and in so doing possess an animate inanimateness. Yet, the inherent reciprocal flow between childhood and adulthood is prompted by a blur of two genres: still life and the landscape. Her recent paintings reveal a horizon that expands the scope of the composition. Consequently, they become scenes rather than formal arrangements, environments for narrative, situations for verbs as well as adjectives. </p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">The seductive, fermenting mounds of toys revel in the stuff of their making, in their own raw material: fossil fuels, petroleum-derived polymers. Here all is plastic and plastic is all&mdash;the medium for the megalography and rhopography of a child&rsquo;s world, the medium for variance in the adult&rsquo;s. A curiously withholding light seeps through the paintings along with a range of disquieting social, political, and cultural associations such as the sallowness of late capitalism, specters of terrorism, the odd stirrings and disruptions of seasonal weather, and wounds of a warming planet.</p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">The transformation that occurs within the paintings is initiated and sustained through the creative process by the optical allure of the toys within Marlatt&rsquo;s eye. It is symbolically and, therefore, emotionally and psychologically effective solely because of her particular manipulation of visual form. Seduced by the mutable charm of her subject matter and the pulpiness of paint, she follows her instincts and allows form to lead the way. Marlatt is not establishing specific narrative structures or systems of symbolism&mdash;this would probably mean utter failure for the paintings, placing them within the realm of kitsch. As writer and critic Guy Davenport has said: &ldquo;&hellip;language knew it for [her]&hellip;, and carried the meaning as genes pass on information from organism to organism.&rdquo; In these captivating paintings of plastic he-men, evil queens, super heroes, roly-poly puppies, transformers, Disney characters, building blocks, and mummy sarcophagi, Marlatt has unwittingly tapped in to an archetypal power. <br />
