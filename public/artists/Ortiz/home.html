<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Mata Ortiz pottery comes from the high plains of Northern
  Mexico just below the American southwest. Like 20th century
  Native American pottery, it is the story of revival. However, this
  remarkable revival of the region’s ceramic tradition was begun by
  one man, Juan Quezada, and through him spread to much of
  a small remote river valley village, Juan Mata Ortiz, located in
  northern Chihuahua State.</p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Master potter Juan Quezada, a vaquero from Mata Ortiz, explored
as a boy the mountains and valleys of the Casas Grandes region
where he found shards of ancient pottery, sometimes elaborately
painted, which became his source of inspiration. These were
from the once great city of Paquimé (Mexico), which was
inhabited around the same time as Mesa Verde (Colorado) and
Chaco Canyon (New Mexico). Shards of Paquimé pottery have
also been found in the southwest and Texas. Despite only a
formal education to third grade, Juan wondered about the people
who made the pottery and how it was done. At first he tried
repairing some of the ancient pottery and later he attempted to
make his own.</p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">After many years of observation and experimentation, in 1970s
Juan succeeded in recreating the whole pottery making process
used in Paquimé over 500 years ago. This was a remarkable
feat in a town where there was no current tradition of making
pots and no one working as a potter. He had developed the
techniques of locating and mining local clays, tempering the clay
with sand, forming the pots, using minerals and clays for
decoration, and firing the pots.</p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Spencer MacCallum, a trained anthropologist and art historian,
noticed Juan Quesada’s work in a New Mexico trading post.
Through MacCallum’s help and support Quesada found that he
could support his family making pots. Juan taught what he
had learned to his brothers and sisters. They in turn taught other
family members and friends. Now over 300 of the town’s 1000
residents make pottery making potting the dominant occupation
of the village. With many masters among this number, Mata
Oritz pottery has been displayed in museum in the United States,
Mexico, Japan, and Europe.</p>
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Many styles have emerged from the potters of Mata Ortiz and
their work continues to evolve due to several factors. First,
because there is no long-standing pottery tradition and second,
because of the Mata Ortiz potters fire their pots individually.
The solo firing, which differs from Southwestern Native American
techniques, reduces the risk of experimentation.</p>
