  The scenes in Elizabeth Schoyer's   paintings bear little resemblance to the real places visited by the authors of   the 18th- and 19th-century natural histories, travel accounts, and scientific   compendia that stirred her imagination. There are no individual demonstrations   of fact, crisp illustrations, or specimens gathered for arrangement and   classification. Instead, these painted voyages of discovery enact elusive   propositions about human vulnerability, futility, natural menace, inadvertent   depredation, process, decay, and memory. Archaic contraptions mine the seas for   imprecisely drawn little creatures suggesting coral, shells, and seaweed. A   ship's slow progress into uncharted southern waters and an arctic ice storm are   conveyed more by spatial metaphor than by narrative. For example, we look down   on Bartram's Florida where the shadow of a ship writ small becomes an insect on   a veiny leaf, or, back in focus from above, the whole becomes a heart-shaped   swamp whose rich vegetation is concocted from thin washes, drips, and smudges of   oil paint in earth tones with an overlay of stringy pencil line. Elsewhere the   fictitious Narwhal's polar encampment leaves fragile net-like traces on a   precipitously inclined plane of cracked ice, or the hard geometry of tents and   implements is swallowed in a dappled maelstrom. <br />
  <br />
  Schoyer can speak of the   objects in her paintings as if they were real and functional. About Tools for   Removing Ambergris, for example, she tells us, &quot;the main object in the painting   is a house, Asian in influence, floating on ice. At the end of the gangplank is   a net-trap used for fishing. There are also large cauldrons used for boiling   whale oil and various other tools and small hand-held nets.&quot; In her painting,   however, these are rendered as whimsical structures and fragile accoutrements   deployed without purpose in an unreal flattened seascape. Schoyer acknowledges   that her compositions owe something to Japanese prints and Indian miniatures,   though their sense of displacement is all her own. We are asked to ponder the   strangeness of a house whose transparent walls are linked by taut cords to a   pleated roof, as stiff and unnatural as gessoed drapery, a house hovering above   an oily surface of rusty black bearing cottony patches of ice. We are left to   wonder if this is an oblique commentary on the purposive activity to which the   title refers. <br />
  <br />
  In a series of works inspired by glass conservatories,   fragile architecture suggests human futility in the face of natural process and   change. Letting Off Steam offers a wonderful example of how Schoyer uses her   technical means-crude yet delicate drawing in graphite and white pencil on a   ground of richly modulated color-to convey the qualities of the places she   imagines and evokes. Imprecise, atmospheric space is conjured in veils of   yellow, red and orange, wiped and layered and then laced with a pearly pink.   Glass towers are spun out of bundles of lines in thwarted grids, the boundaries   of misty spaces pulled tight with a control that belies the hothouse   impossibility of it all. <br />
  <br />
  Linnaeus's Theory is another instance of   brilliant color, primitive drawing and perspective, and a serious theme   combining to create an effect that is both humorous and grim. The title refers   to the 18th-century naturalist's contention that, rather than migrate in winter,   birds hibernate underwater. Imagining the implications of this view, as debunked   fictionally in a recent short story by Andrea Barrett, Schoyer drew in pencil   three diminutive dying birds fluttering at the juncture of two broad planes of   color. One plane is a cross-sectional view underwater, its color the tonic,   salty red of fresh blood; the other represents the water's surface,   incongruously seen from above, a serene blue threaded with chalky ice floes. <br />
  <br />
  Schoyer's works are a record of process, both natural and artistic.   Suspending, plumbing, extracting, probing, mining, rubbing, brushing, wiping   away, daubing and scribbling-these investigations arrive at images that are   neither representational nor symbolic but suggestive of meanings that are fluid,   evanescent, and mysteriously singular. -JoAnne C.
