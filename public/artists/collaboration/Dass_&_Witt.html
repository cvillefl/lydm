<p><span class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">The angels of transfiguration speak from the heart of dark light because   long ago they abandoned themselves to being dissolved in its depths: &ldquo;It belongs   to the holy image which we are shaping,&rdquo; H&ouml;lderlin wrote to a friend on the eve   of a mental, physical and emotional breakdown from which he never recovered.   Deranged classicism and a beautifully warped sense of the proportions of the   soul seem to have been his territory, through which a damaged and lucid calling   beckoned him to release himself through art. The show takes its name from the   &lsquo;dark light&rsquo; of Remembrance, a thing H&ouml;lderlin imagines one is capable of   drinking. And yet it was dark light that drank H&ouml;lderlin. <br />
    <br />
    When he wrote   about this holy image, he might as well have been writing about collaboration.   Art, no matter its medium, is always direct collaboration. In our own lives, the   agent, the instrument of memory is nothing other than the image. No matter how   it&rsquo;s rendered, no matter what medium it is inscribed in, whether the shades   paint their moment in adjectives and figurative modes of expression, or whether   such dark light glimpses itself into being in the way shade and light interact   to play off gold leaf, burnished to a high shine, it threatens your reflected   face as much as it gives it back to you in a world of rust, birds, and faces   that might be childishly abstract were they not so wounded, scarified, and   smeared. <br />
    <br />
    The pictures that this poetic image has loosed come from the   intensely private workshops of each artist, thrown open (reluctantly, one   senses) not just to each other, but to the public. These are the artistic   processes that take my breath away&mdash;ancient but not yet anachronistic&mdash;and it is a   miracle that the product of each creative act conceals the simple fact that one   can sit in a room and tug on one end of the pretty chain which binds him to   H&ouml;lderlin, and feel the tautness, the resonance in the images themselves. <br />
    <br />
    I am no stranger to this phenomenon. Sometimes when I write, I hear   Keats, not exactly coughing in my ear, but as a quiet presence in the air around   me. It is an intensification of the relationship we alone of all creatures enjoy   with the dead, radiating a presence fraught with pain and potential. I imagine   that Dass and Witt feel the presence of H&ouml;lderlin: the mystic in me wants to   argue that contagion works across time with influence and collaboration as its   vessels. He is meaningful to these artists not just through some admiration or   natural affinity, but as one of the &lsquo;first among equals&rsquo; in the unending line of   creative latter-day saints, completely absorbed in their worlds, even to the   point of madness: Blake, Eliot, Rubl&euml;v, even Hannah Cohoon. Dass and Witt have   engaged in equal parts alchemical natural philosophy and ritualized ancestor   worship. T.S. Eliot put it this way: the artist &ldquo;is not likely to know what is   to be done unless he lives in what is not merely the present, but the present   moment of the past.&rdquo; <br />
    <br />
    Think of dark light as the chamber in which   selfhood and identity are broken down under a colluded, articulating pressure of   formulation and change; or the kind of sacrifice that must necessarily initiate   the shaping of the images you see here; or perhaps it is another name for irony,   the personality of history itself. Packs of contagion (to filch a phrase from   Deleuze) work back and forth across time, just as they work between individual   artists, themselves cells of a particular osmosis that can be shared. All   moments are now&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it dark light that threads them together? &ldquo;Eternity is in   love with the productions of time,&rdquo; wrote William Blake, even though &ldquo;the sea   takes and gives memory,&rdquo; as though an offering were required of each one of us.   The sacrifice is a gentle and rewarding one, begged in a single polyphony of   voice and image: abandon yourself to pure presence and be a witness to this dark   light. </span><span class="body_copy_or_art_description"><br />
