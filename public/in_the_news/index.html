A professor of printmaking at UVA, Dass took up landscape painting in 1994 while on sabbatical in New Hampshire.

<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">&quot;On a sunny autumn Saturday afternoon in November, I took some time to visit Lyn Bolen Warren at her rural hilltop home and gallery twelve miles Northeast of downtown Charlottesville. It sits high and well away from the road leading up through a forest, and when rounding the final bend, what appears is the panorama of a Piedmont vista framed by two very unique modern buildings. On the left is villa-like series of residential pavilions for her family and on the right is a new art gallery designed by W G Clark sandwiched between walls translucent glass block and sheets of Corten steel. Beyond this is a gently sloping grassy meadow, and beyond that is a humble gable form horse barn set into the trees."</p>

<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">"<a href="/artists/Warren/" class="center_link">Russ Warren</a> is a Charlottesville fine artist who has been producing drawings, paintings and mixed media pieces since the early seventies and has exhibited extensively both in the US and abroad, including the Whitney Biennial in 1981 and the Venice Biennial in 1984. In looking over the body of his work, you see overlapping themes that spiral and resurface throughout the years - Picasso influences, southwest American, Spanish and South American influences, montages of collected materials, autobiographical sources. One of the big themes is his love and passion for music. I've met so many artists who've had to make tough decisions about directions for their creativity, which isn't typically limited to just one sense. In our interview, he had a few warm and telling stories about how one's innate creative passions are carved by circumstances and seemingly small events and exposures can make or break a direction." <a href="http://publications.catstonepress.com/i/97088/10" target="_blank" class="center_link">Read interview  &gt;</a>

One could easily perceive this as a conscious reaction against technological developments, however, may gastritis, such as Anne Chesnut (whose digital print Punctuated: Asterisk is on view here), interestingly employ lithography, woodcut, or other print media in the creation of their work which is digitally printed in its final form. So while some artists may be attracted to the immediacy of gouging into a block of wood, or applying pigment directly onto a sheet of glass or metal to produce a monotype, there seems to be a growing acceptance of exploring all print media as fodder for producing the desired image. Embracing digital techniques doesn't necessarily require the abandonment of more traditional ones.”</span>
