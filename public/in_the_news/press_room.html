<p class="center_subhead_minor_2">Les Yeux du Monde presents<br>
Trisha Orr: <em>Still Life and Other Subjects</em><br />
 3 April - 11 May 2014<br>
Opening Reception, Thursday, 3 April, 5 - 7:30 p.m.</p>

<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Les Yeux du Monde presents <em>Trisha Orr: Still Life and Other Subjects</em> from April 3 - May 11, 2014.  Trisha Orr received national attention as a painter of still life in the 1990’s when Art in America described her as having “entered into the ranks of late-century American flower painters…. (Yet) delving into (her) work yields a richness and a complexity that are Orr’s alone.”   The earliest of the paintings in this show are from 2008 and represent an evolution of her closely observed, illusionistic style.  In more recent paintings, the ‘body/soul’ series, the objects depicted have been simplified while paint application has become more tactile and expressive. Another aspect of Orr’s recent work embodies poems (by her husband, the poet Gregory Orr) that evoke the lyric boldness of graffiti on weathered, urban walls. </p>   
 
<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">There will be an opening reception on <b>Thursday, 3 April from 5 - 7:30</b>, so as not to coincide with First Fridays. There will also  be a Lunch with the Artist on Wednesday, 16 April at noon.  Reservations required ($12, free for Collectors Club).  
The gallery is located at 841 Wolf Trap Road in Charlottesville and is open Thursday through Sunday 1 - 5 and by appointment. 434-973-5566 or 434-882-2620.   <a href="/">www.LesYeuxduMonde.com</a>.</p>

<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced"><a href="/artists/Steger/" class="center_link">Kurt Steger</a> first conceived of his Burden Boat in response to an invitation to show at Virginia Tech.
The campus was still reeling in shock and sorrow from the massacre that had taken place just two years
earlier. Steger writes "I felt a compulsion to create an art piece that might help facilitate healing." The
burden boat project was born, a twelve-foot vessel made of ceramic and wood with cotton bags filled
with hallowed ground from the Virginia Tech campus. It was initiated at the exhibition's opening on
September 11, 2009. During the show, people were invited to write their burdens on scraps of paper or
send them in by mail or email and place the written burdens into the boat. At the end of the show there
was a ceremonial burning and burying of the burdens, personal and collective.</p>

<p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">There will be a kick off event at Les Yeux du Monde on Tuesday, December 13 from 5 - 8, which will feature art, music, festive holiday fare and libations, and a preview of the trailer to <em>Amazon Gold</em>. There will also be a first glimpse at <a href="/artists/Dass/" class="center_link">Dean Dass</a>'s earth affirming video <em>The Winter War</em>. The $40 suggested donation covers the price to protect an acre of the Amazon (see www.acrecare.org). Additional acres may be adopted as gifts at the event and throughout the following week, in the hopes of helping the Amazon Aid Foundation meet their goal of having placed 250 acres of the Amazon into protection before the end of the year. A portion of all art sales that evening and through the 23rd will also be donated to the Amazon Aid Foundation.  The Dean Dass exhibition, <em>Heaven and Earth</em>, is on view in the main gallery and other art $25 and up will be available. The intent is to offer alternatives and gifts that also give back to our endangered earth. <em>Art and Acres</em>  will be available daily from Dec. 14 through the 23rd at Les Yeux du Monde from 1 - 5 p.m. and by appointment.</p>

          <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Les Yeux du Monde is proud to present <em><strong>Clay Witt</strong>: The Peaceable Kingdom</em> for its final show of the season and in the current venue, at 500 West Main Street. The exhibition will open on Friday 5 December and run through December 31. There will be a First Friday opening reception with the artist from 5:30 – 8 p.m.</p>
          
          <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Witt joined the Les Yeux du Monde stable two years ago in a legendary two-person exhibition, <em><a href="../artists/collaboration/Dass_&amp;_Witt.html" class="center_link">Dark Light</a></em> with his former professor and mentor, Dean Dass. This very popular exhibition highlighted both individual and collaborative works by these two artists who have pioneered new techniques in printmaking and painting in combination with time honored traditions and materials. Since 2006, Witt has been honing and perfecting these techniques and materials to create his latest body of work, which will debut in this exhibition, entitled <em>The Peaceable Kingdom</em>.</p>
          
          <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Witt took the title for the show and for the largest work in the exhibition from a series of nineteenth century American paintings by the Quaker artist Edward Hicks with this subject matter and title. Witt writes, “to me, Hicks represents the essential mystical folk artist of our country’s nineteenth century adolescence, an artistic genre to which I feel a great aesthetic affinity.”</p>
          
          
            <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Of the unusual technique Witt employs to create his luminescent works, he writes:
            <blockquote class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">“While my works may at first glance resemble straightforward paintings, they are in fact expressions of an idiosyncratic
              technical style that I have developed over the past two decades, one that incorporates intaglio printmaking, collage,
              gilding, and polished varnish layering into a final product that recalls the visual tropes of religious art as much as it does
              anything else.” He parallels his “laborious and time-consuming process” (which results in no more than five large
              paintings a year) with a “sort of mystical artistic quest.” The resulting paintings are otherworldly, astral, and vibrate
              somewhere between this world and the next. Most feature images of an eerie nature—spindly trees and animals reside
              together with Biblical and classical references. Witt refers to his final paintings as “a self-revealing series of contemporary
              icons that, while not allied with any particular creed or dogma, do in fact reflect my interest and research into the
              artistic expressions of religious faith.”</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Witt is currently a Visiting Artist at the University of Virginia. Born in Belgium to a family from Richmond VA, he grew up in England before returning to the United States where he completed his BA in printmaking and sculpture from the University of Virginia and his MFA in painting from the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. He also received a Fulbright grant to apprentice to a Master Calligrapher in Damascus, Syria in 2001, an experience he considers one of his “most significant” and influential courses of study.</p>
          
          <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">There are several events planned in conjunction with the exhibition in addition to the <em>First Friday Opening</em>, December 5, from 5:30 until 8:00 pm. There will also be a <a href="../calendar/feast_on_art.html" class="center_link">Feast on Art</a> lunch with the artist on Wednesday, December 10 at noon. Please call the gallery at 434.973.5566 or email us at LesYeuxduMonde@aol.com to make reservations for this lunch. The cost is $10 per person. On 16 December at 5 p.m. Witt will unveil a new print for the <a href="../calendar/collectors_club.html" class="center_link">Collectors’ Club</a>, followed by an <em>Artist’s Talk and Slide Show </em>at 6 p.m. The talk is free and open to the public.</p>
          
          <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Gallery hours for December are Tuesday – Saturday 11 – 5, Sunday from 1 – 5 and by appointment. Please visit our website, www.lesyeuxdumonde.com for more information.</p>

          <p class="body_copy_or_art_description_double_spaced">Landscape painter Annie Harris Massie, a resident of Lynchburg, Virginia, produces beautiful and ephemeral landscapes, drawing on what appears to be a fleeting afterimage to capture the essence of time, place, and space.  The use of light in her works is what makes these images remarkable—light is an active player in the scene, dancing across objects and throwing others in shadow.  As a result her landscapes remain imbued with a dynamic yet soft quality.</p>
